### Autism Screening Adult Data Set

This *advanced* level data set has Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Screening Test Data for 704 adults. There are 21 attributes in the dataset that include test takers' 
demographics such as *Age*, *Gender*, *Ethnicity* etc. The screening test included 10 questions (A1 to A10) that test takers answered. In each of these 10 questions, 
the test takers were given a statement with which they had to agree or disagree. For example, the statement at question A1 is "I often notice small sounds when other do not".
The test takers' responses to A1 and A10 are coded as binary values (0,1). Once the test taker has answered all 10 questions, his/her status on ASD is determined which 
is recorded under **Class/ASD** variable. You can encouraged to explore the [ASD Test Mobile App](http://asdtests.com/#)           


This data set is recommended for learning and practicing your skills in **exploratory data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **classification modelling techniques**. 
Feel free to explore the data set with multiple **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques. The Following data dictionary gives more details on this data set:
